# What is Liquid Staking on TON?

TON Liquid Staking (LSt) is a protocol that allows TON holders of all caliber to participate in TON blockchain validation through assets pooling.

In exchange for staking Toncoin using TON Liquid Staking users receive a liquid staking receipt token called Jetton Pool.&#x20;

Rewards in TON LSt essentially come from validation rewards, however technically on the pool level it comes from interest payments from validators that lend funds for staking.

The Jetton Pool token defines the current volume of staked funds in a pool for all users making use of the pool. During this time, the ratio of Jetton Pool to TON increases. As a result, users can claim their accrued rewards in Jetton Pool by exchanging their Jetton Pool for TON as an incentive for using the platform.&#x20;

Lending on TON Blockchain offers an opportunity for users (Nominators) and TON Ecosystem participants (Validators) to connect their funds and hardware to the networkâ€™s validation process to contribute to network voting. This process allows users to lend their funds to special smart contract called Pool (liquidity pools).

TON LSt protocol allows for the distribution of fundraising and maintenance of hardware between a large number of participants. In this way, participants are easily able to participate in the Pool whether they can contribute funds, technical skills, or hardware. This lowers the barrier to entry to access the platform, allowing nearly any user to participate.
