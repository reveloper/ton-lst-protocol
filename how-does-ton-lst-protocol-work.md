# How does TON LSt protocol work?

## Overview

The Open Network Blockchain makes use of a Proof of Stake consensus model. Like all PoS blockchains, this means that the network’s security and stability is maintained by a set of network validators. Therefore, it is possible for anyone to contribute to network validation by running a validator (should they meet the predetermined requirements). In exchange, all validators contribute to the architectural security of the network in exchange for block validation TON rewards.

Liquid staking allows participants to make use of staking pools that allow them to stake their Toncoin on the platform.&#x20;

Stakers, also known as Nominators, are TON holders who stake their funds in a pool to be used for validation. In other words, these are users who nominate a pool to exercise their validation rights.

TON LSt also helps define proper governance of the protocol through a group of participants that manage arbitrary liquid staking pools on the network. Liquidity is provided by lending user funds from pools to validators at a predetermined interest rate.

### Decentralization

TON Liquid Staking allows users to lend their funds through specialized smart contracts (liquidity pools) via securely managed funds that flow between Pools, Validators, and Electors through each round of the TON validation process. During each 36-hour validation cycle, validators receive rewards in the form of network commissioned tokens created through inflation which are then spread among all participants of the Liquid Staking Pool (in proportion to their deposit size).

In the event of a potential network outage or downtime via misbehaving validators or malicious actors, validators collectively penalize (through a process called slashing) those deemed responsible.

* Stakers participate in network updates through voting with pool jettons
* Governance DAO, being separated from both validators and stakers, and having long-term incentives aligned with TON network prosperity enforces proper behavior of validators, usability, and high liquidity of pool jettons
* Independent validators, compete with each other for getting higher profits for themselves and stakers

In particular, in fully developed protocol implementation,

In liquid staking protocol, one of the primary focuses was on improving decentralisation and thus stability and safety of network.

Started with a mid-size minimal stake of 10'000 TON and dozens of validators on the inception of TON Blockchain, the validation industry grew significantly and currently reached more than 200 million TON and three hundred validators in each round. Accordingly, the minimal stake per round reached 300'000 TON which is well beyond the capabilities of a typical holder. While such a large amount of TON in validation made the network more secure and tokenomics more stable it simultaneously pushed control over network from the larger community to the professional and well funded actors. Some efforts to overcome this trend were made by existing staking pools, however retail ones are primary focused on profitability, while TF nominator pool which allows nominator to express their opinion on network updates require high minimal stake. Besides, these staking solutions conduce to concentration of collation and validation operations in the hands of single pool operator.

### Keyable features of LSt Protocol



1. **​Pool Jettons**: Pool jettons are liquid staking receipt tokens representing native TON token shares in liquidity pools on the TON Liquid Staking protocol. The idea behind pTON allows users to deposit their TON tokens and receive pTON tokens in exchange, enabling them to maintain liquidity and stake on the protocol while also allowing users to convert their pTON back into TON at any time should they choose to withdraw their funds.
2. **Liquidity Provision**: liquidity provisioning allows users to lend TON to Validators to increase their overall liquidity. This allows Validators to borrow TON from a liquidity pool and return their funds after incurring interest on their assets, ensuring they have the necessary resources to actively participate in network validation and consensus.
3. **Deposits and Withdrawals:** The ability to withdraw and deposit assets into the TON Liquid Staking protocol allows users to deposit and withdraw their assets with no predetermined minimum or maximum deposit threshold. The protocol manages deposits and withdrawals through specialized smart contracts, ensuring accurate accounting and proper handling of user funds and transactions.

### TON Liquid Staking is User Agnostic

* Service availability for all users even those with small amounts of capital.
* High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) can participate without having to work through complex technical issues.
* Tech teams are able to run validators on minimal budgets lending the missing part for validation at interest, while still having a payback after the loan is repaid. Through this system Validators avoid inefficiencies related to marketing because it is handled solely by Governors which focuses solely on the technical side.
* Thanks to TON’s modular architecture, it is possible to securely update the protocol by conducting the appropriate testing before updates are implemented.
