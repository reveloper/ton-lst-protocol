# Description

### Introduction

Pool smart contracts are a central component of asset lending on the TON Liquid Staking protocol.

### Pool&#x20;

#### Definition and function

The _Pool Central Contract_ is the main driving architectural framework of the TON Liquid Staking protocol and the main arbiter that lends assets to Controllers and aggregates profit/loss information from them.

#### Interaction with Controllers

The Pool Contract caters to Validator Controllers by lending assets according to the Current Rate when a borrowing request is received.

#### Interaction with Users (Stakers, Nominators)

Users, or stakers as they are sometimes known, represent regular users within the greater TON ecosystem. The Pool Central Contract is designed to manage users' deposits and withdrawals.

#### Interaction with Interest Manager

The Pool Central Contract is continuously connected with the Interest Manager and helps provision important data for the protocol. It dispatches aggregate lending statistics and modifies interest rates upon receiving a request from the Interest Manager.

#### Interaction with Governance

Governance helps provide equitable governance of the TON Liquid Staking Protocol. Because of this fact, governors are in continuous communication with the Pool Central Contract. The contract forwards a share of the profits to networks Governors and updates deposit parameters and roles upon request. Governors are typically represented as a DAO or multi-signature wallet.

To provision the equitability of the liquid staking protocol, TONs Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) helps decide key parameters (such as setting protocol fees, interest rates, and more) through governance voting. This framework leverages the voting power of governance token (jetton) holders to make protocol and ecosystem decisions based on voting weight.&#x20;

The DAO also accumulates service fees from users which are used to allocate funds towards protocol research, protocol and ecosystem development, liquidity incentives, and protocol upgrades.\

### Pool Jetton

Pool Jettons represent a collateralized asset users receive in exchange for depositing TON into the TON Liquid Staking protocol. Pool Jettons are used to provision the management of user assets lent to specific liquidity pools within the protocol.&#x20;

### Payouts (Bills)

Deposits and withdrawals serve as the lifeblood of asset transactions on the protocol. While employing strict mode we presume that the Pool Jetton to TON ratio is unknown until the consensus round ends, postponing the actual transactions. However, optimistic mode can be used as long as measures are in place to mitigate misbehaving validators.

### Nominator and Validator

Nominators and Validators are the participants operating on TON that are participating in supporting TON maintenance with their own funds and hardware correspondingly.

### Soft Defined Components

#### Halters

Halters act as an emergency safeguard for the TON Liquid Staking protocol and are capable of halting the protocol's operations in case of major system issues.

#### Sudoers

While initially empty, Sudoers gain the ability to send arbitrary messages from various parts of the system. Allowed to use only after being set more than sudoer\_threshold seconds prior (expected to be 24 hours).

#### Approvers

Approvers grant approvals to Controllers when they initiate an in-protocol borrowing request to ensure overall system integrity and compliance.

#### Interest Managers

Interest Managers receive validator round statistics and update interest parameters to enable dynamic interest rate management (changes in interest rates that will be available for loans).

#### Governance

Governance represents the protocolâ€™s main DAO governance contract used to manage the most important pool components (this process is provisioned through TON token governance voting).

### Validator Election

Validators participate in regular validator elections via a Controller smart contract which manages funds from the liquidity pool while ensuring that lent assets are secure.
