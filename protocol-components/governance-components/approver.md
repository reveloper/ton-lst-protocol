It decides and enforces whether Pool validators follow decentralization and safety measures set by Governance, and thus can be a simple wallet or multisignature wallet in the long run.&#x20;

### Security Policy

Non-custodial wallet.

### Deploy policy

Approver could be deployed in the Basechain.
