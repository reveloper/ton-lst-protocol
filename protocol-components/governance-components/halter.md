# Halter

### Overview

Halters act as an emergency safeguard for the TON Liquid Staking protocol and are capable of halting the protocol's operations in case of major system issues.

It is a role, which needs to be a hot wallet (private key stored in memory). It is a special role needed only during initial deployment while audits and practice still didn't prove 100% safety. In the long run, this role should be disembodied.&#x20;



### Security Policy

* Could be used with a Hot wallet (non-custodial wallet) for Pool preparation stage.
* Disembodied with the public production release of the Pool.

### Deploy Policy

Halter could be deployed in the Basechain.
