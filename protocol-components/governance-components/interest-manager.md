# Interest Manager

### Overview

Interest Manager may be performed by a wallet, multisignature wallet, or DAO. It is expected that the final revision will be a smart contract that implements some equilibria logic.

The interest Manager defines the interest rate at which the pool lends funds to the validator. Due to designing it is important to determine rates in such a way that the proposed rate can cover the cost of the validator, taking into account, that often the maintenance of the validator hardware is paid in fiat equivalent.



### Deploy Policy

Interest Manager could be deployed in the Basechain.
